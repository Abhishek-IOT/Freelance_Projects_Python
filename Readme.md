# Python Automation & Data Engineering Projects

Welcome to my Python Projects Repository! ðŸš€

This repository is a collection of real-world automation, data integration, and backend utility scripts developed using Python. Each folder inside this repository represents a standalone project, solving practical use cases using tools such as:

- REST APIs (GET/POST integrations)
- Data Cleaning & Transformation (`pandas`)
- CSV/Excel automation
- Cloud integrations (AWS, Google Sheets, etc.)
- Scheduling with `cron` / Task Scheduler
